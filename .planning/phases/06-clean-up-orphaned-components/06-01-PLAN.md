<objective>
Remove orphaned components from Phase 1 that are no longer used in the codebase.

Purpose: Clean up tech debt identified in v1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md - these components exist but are not imported anywhere, causing confusion and unnecessary code maintenance.

Output: 3 orphaned Svelte component files deleted.

## Orphaned Components Analysis

From grep search:
- ImageCard.svelte: NOT imported anywhere in the codebase
- TagList.svelte: NOT imported anywhere in the codebase  
- PullProgress.svelte: Only imported as TYPE in InstanceList.svelte (`import type { PullProgress }`), not as component. The .svelte file is orphaned but the type in types.ts is still used.

## Verification Evidence

```bash
grep -r "ImageCard" src/ --include="*.svelte" 
# No results - truly orphaned

grep -r "TagList" src/ --include="*.svelte"
# No results - truly orphaned

grep -r "PullProgress" src/ --include="*.svelte"
# Results show only "import type { PullProgress }" - component not used
```

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Delete ImageCard.svelte</name>
  <files>src/lib/components/ImageCard.svelte</files>
  <action>
    Delete the file src/lib/components/ImageCard.svelte

    This component was created in Phase 1 for displaying Docker images but was replaced by inline UI in InstanceForm. It is not imported anywhere in the codebase.

    Use bash to verify file exists before deletion: `ls src/lib/components/ImageCard.svelte`
  </action>
  <verify>
    ls src/lib/components/ImageCard.svelte
    # Expected: No such file or directory
  </verify>
  <done>
    ImageCard.svelte does not exist in src/lib/components/
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Delete TagList.svelte</name>
  <files>src/lib/components/TagList.svelte</files>
  <action>
    Delete the file src/lib/components/TagList.svelte

    This component was created in Phase 1 for displaying Docker image tags but InstanceForm has inline tag selection instead. It is not imported anywhere in the codebase.

    Use bash to verify file exists before deletion: `ls src/lib/components/TagList.svelte`
  </action>
  <verify>
    ls src/lib/components/TagList.svelte
    # Expected: No such file or directory
  </verify>
  <done>
    TagList.svelte does not exist in src/lib/components/
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Delete PullProgress.svelte</name>
  <files>src/lib/components/PullProgress.svelte</files>
  <action>
    Delete the file src/lib/components/PullProgress.svelte

    This component was created in Phase 1 for showing pull progress but InstanceList has inline progress overlay instead. The component is not imported anywhere - only the PullProgress TYPE is used from types.ts.

    IMPORTANT: Do NOT delete the PullProgress type from src/lib/types.ts - only the .svelte component file.

    Use bash to verify file exists before deletion: `ls src/lib/components/PullProgress.svelte`
  </action>
  <verify>
    ls src/lib/components/PullProgress.svelte
    # Expected: No such file or directory
    
    # Verify type still exists (should NOT be deleted):
    grep -n "PullProgress" src/lib/types.ts
    # Expected: Type definition still present
  </verify>
  <done>
    PullProgress.svelte component file deleted, but PullProgress type in types.ts preserved
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

## Overall Phase Verification

After all tasks complete:

1. Verify all 3 files deleted:
   ```bash
   ls src/lib/components/ | grep -E "ImageCard|TagList|PullProgress"
   # Expected: No output (files should not exist)
   ```

2. Verify no broken imports:
   ```bash
   grep -r "ImageCard\|TagList\|PullProgress" src/ --include="*.svelte" | grep -v "import type"
   # Expected: No output (no broken imports)
   ```

3. Verify project still builds:
   ```bash
   cd src-tauri && cargo check
   # Expected: No errors
   ```
